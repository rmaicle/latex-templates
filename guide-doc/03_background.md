# Background



## Software Technologies



### \TeX

\textit{\TeX} or _TeX_ is a typesetting system designed and written by
by Donald E. Knuth starting in 1977.
It is popular for producing book quality text for scientific and
technical works.
It has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical
systems.
The source code of TeX has been placed into the _public domain_.

\TeX\space is the ISO basic Latin alphabet rendering of the Greek
letters _tau_, _epsilon_, and _chi_ (\textit{$\tau\epsilon\chi$}).
The Greek letter *chi* ($\chi$) is pronounced as 'ch' in the Scottish
word _loch_ like in _lochness monster_ or the abbreviation _tech_ from
the word _technology_.
The typeset *epsilon* character, $\epsilon$, that appears displaced in
\TeX\space is intentional to distinguish it as the typesetting system.
In computer files that does not allow \TeX\space to be written with the
displaced 'E' character, it is usually written as _TeX_.

Since version 3.0 of TeX, updates have been indicated by adding an extra
digit at the end of the decimal.
This version numbering system will asymptotically approach the value of
$\pi$.
The current version of TeX is 3.14159265, last updated on January 12,
2014.



### \LaTeX

\textit{\LaTeX} or _LaTeX_  is a document preparation system
created  by Leslie B. Lamport based on TeX to simplify TeX typesetting
and is called the \LaTeX format (Lamport TeX).
It is pronounced either as "Lah-tech" or "Lay-tech".

In September 1984, Lamport released version 2.06a of the LaTeX macros.
In August 1985, version 2.09 was released.
LaTeX2e, also known as _The New Standard LaTeX_ is the current version
since it replaced version 2.09 in 1994[^latex-209].
As of 2019, LaTeX3, which was started in the early 1990s, is a long-term
research project to develop the next version of the LaTeX typesetting
system.

 LaTeX is free software and is distributed under the LaTeX Project
 Public License (LPPL).

[^latex-209]: Lamport releases LaTeX 2.09, his last version of the
LaTeX macros. (Incidentally, version 2.09 was to be called
"version 3.0", but Addison-Wesley ignored Lamport's instructions not
to publish the note that mentions 2.09, and instead put it on the
copyright page. So Lamport's last version of LaTeX became known as
version 2.09 for posterity.)



### Markdown

_Markdown_ is a plain text formatting syntax primarily intended to be
easy to write and easy to read.
The markdown language was created by John Gruber in 2004 with the
collaboration of Aaron Swartz on the formatting syntax.
Since then, Markdown gave rise to other variants like MultiMarkdown,
GitHub Flavored Markdown, and CommonMark.
CommonMark was started in 2012 as an effort to standardize the Markdown
syntax by a group of people including Jeff Atwood and John MacFarlane.



### Portable Document Format

Portable Document Format (PDF) refers to a file format based on the
PostScript language that encapsulates a complete description of a
document which includes fonts, vector graphics, raster images and other
information.

_PDF_ was developed by Adobe as a proprietary format and later released
as an open standard on July 1, 2008.
It was then published by the International Organization for
Standardization as ISO 32000-1:2008 in the same year.

ISO 32000-1:2008 references version 1.7 of the PDF specification which
contains proprietary technologies defined only by Adobe.
These proprietary technologies that are not standardized and whose
specifications are published only on Adobe's website are not supported
by popular third-party PDF implementations.
ISO 32000-2:2017 which was published on July 28, 2017 does not include
any proprietary technologies as normative references.



## Tools and Utilities



### TeX Live

_TeX Live_ is a cross-platform, free software distribution for the TeX
document production system.
TeX Live was originally started by Sebastian Rahtz in 1996 in
collaboration with the TeX user groups worldwide.
It includes major TeX-related programs, macro packages, and fonts for
most flavors of Unix, including GNU/Linux, macOS, and the Microsoft
Windows operating system.

### Pandoc

_Pandoc_ is a tool written by John MacFarlane since 2006 for converting
from one markup format to another.
Pandoc understands an extended and slightly revised version of John
Gruber's Markdown[^markdown-intro] syntax.
These extensions and revisions are necessary to provide multiple output
formats aimed by Pandoc's design.

This document references pandoc version 2.7.3.

### PP

_PP_ is a an open source text preprocessor for Pandoc.
The preprocessor can be used to generate diagrams, execute arbitrary
shell script and display the output in a code block or simply display
source files in code blocks.
