## Preface

A *preface* is usually written by the author of a book and often
gives an overview of how the book came to be written, its intended
purpose, and to what extent it covers the topic. It may come before
or after the foreword, but it usually comes after and follows the
same page numbering system. The preface may also include
acknowledgements.[^preface_wlmoore]
