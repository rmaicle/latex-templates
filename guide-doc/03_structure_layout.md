## Foreword



## Preface

A _preface_ is a major section in a book and therefore only applicable
when using a book LaTeX template.

A _preface_ is often written to give an overview of how the book came
to be written, its intended purpose, and to what extent it covers the
topic.
It may come before or after the _foreword_, but it usually comes after
and follows the same page numbering system.
The _preface_ may also include acknowledgements.[^preface_wlmoore]
